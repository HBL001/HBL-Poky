I havent had chance to write this quite yet.

This repo is a meta-custom layer that you need to put in your cloned Poky directory

Go into poky and clone this repo

Make your build environment  . ./OE etc etc

Take the local.conf etc from the install files in this repo.


Do a bitbake core-image-minimal  and it will download and patch everything for you.

The SDcard image will appear as a wic file, and make a card with "sudo dd ......."

Put it in the beagle and boot up.   The card will say "loading from mmc2".  To get rid of that edit the u-boot customisations and get rid of the "sd-card" inverted.

Hopefully I have saved you a day of work !
