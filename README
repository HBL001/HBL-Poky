I havent had chance to write this quite yet.

This repo is a meta-custom layer that you need to put in your cloned Poky directory

Go into poky and clone this repo

Make your build environment  . ./OE etc etc

Take the local.conf etc from the install files in this repo. Dont forget the bblayers or the very nice TI stuff to put in poky/sources

Do a bitbake core-image-minimal  and it will download and patch everything for you.

The SDcard image will appear as a wic file, and use that bmap tool.

Power off, press S2 and boot up.   

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.
