**If you are building a bog standard Beagblebone product, move to the SDCARD branch.**

This repo has some basic changes to the standard TI-meta layer that will improve matters, if you are using the Poky version of Yocto rather than the Arago.

Arago is not being used because HBL also support a lot of other boards and systems that already use the Poky version. 

The repo contents form a meta-custom layer, and also see the install directory for customised local.conf that will boot your BBB

The branch is currently Scarthgap, but Styhead will follow in a few weeks
